Note: Thanks all for coming, and let‚Äôs get started on today‚Äôs workshop. First
thing‚Äôs first, I want you all to open up this presentation on your computers.
It will make things much, much easier. Head on over to

you have to click on links and copy paste things.

## While All That‚Äôs Downloading, Three Processes:

1. Constructing and formatting a CV
1. Publishing the CV online
1. Putting the CV under version control

---

## Constructing and Formatting a CV

1. Edit metadata about CV (formatted in [YAML](https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/)
1. Edit contents of CV sections (formatted in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
1. Process sections and metadata with a shell script
1. Repeat

---

## Publishing the CV Online

1. Getting the Simple-CV code (git clone)
1. Making our changes and processing them (‚Äúconstructing and formatting a CV‚Äù)
1. Adding a milestone to our work (git commit)
1. Putting the work online as a webpage (git push)
1. Repeat (except getting the code)

---

## Putting the CV under Version Control

1. Uh. It‚Äôs time for Git.
1. Wait why Git?
1. Not Git. Please not Git.

---

## Git

* ‚Äúfree and open source distributed version control system designed to handle
everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.‚Äù
* ‚Äúeasy to learn.‚Äù
* A busybody keeping track of all the changes to all your files and never
forgetting them.

Note: That part about ‚Äúeasy to learn‚Äù is probably not true. Git is insanely
powerful, and even people who use it every day probably don‚Äôt use more than a
tiny chunk of it. And that‚Äôs because what IS easy is learning just enough Git
to make it useful for you.

## The Four Steps to Git

1. Save
1. Stage
1. Commit
1. Push

Note: For most purposes if you‚Äôre working on Git on your own, you‚Äôre content
with these four commands. This is a process of recording your work.

---

## The Four Steps to Git

<ol>
<li class="fragment">Save - continuous (with autosave). Not even part of Git.</li>
<li class="fragment">Stage - less frequent. Also known as `git add`.</li>
<li class="fragment">Commit - less frequent still.</li>
<li class="fragment">Push - less frequent still.</li>
</ol>

Note: Saving is what you already do. The files you work with have changes that
get saved to the disk. Then, in staging a file, you‚Äôre giving Git a heads up
to keep track of the changes you have made. In committing, you‚Äôre putting down
a milestone for the changes the files have undergone. And in pushing, you‚Äôre
syncing your new changes with a server.

Note: Here‚Äôs a slightly more visual way to think about this. But you‚Äôll notice
here that I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äúchanges,‚Äù not a ‚Äúdocument.‚Äù This is a central
conceit of Git.

---

## Hopefully downloading is done, so let‚Äôs install‚Ä¶

---

## You‚Äôre not working on a _document_.<br />You‚Äôre working on a _project_.

Note: For the rest of today, we‚Äôll be working on a project that is your CV.
It‚Äôs not a single document. In fact, it‚Äôs many--it‚Äôs at least the html page
that is your online CV and the pdf that is the print version. In a project,
files come and go. They could be datasets, collections of text like chapters
or sections of an article, or even, like in today‚Äôs workshop, the various
parts of your CV.

---

## Back to Publishing the CV Online

1. Getting the Simple-CV code (git clone)
1. Making our changes and processing them (‚Äúconstructing and formatting a CV‚Äù)
1. Adding a milestone to our work (git commit)
1. Putting the work online as a webpage (git push)
1. Repeat (except getting the code)

---

## Getting the Simple-CV Code: GitHub <i class="fab fa-github"></i>

1. Create an account at [github.com](http://github.com)
1. Fork the [`simple-cv`
   repository](http://github.com/plain-plain-text/simple-cv) (or ‚Äúproject.‚Äù)
1. Enable GitHub pages on the new repository

Note: for this part, I get to do some live demoing along with you all. What is
GitHub?

---

## Making changes: Atom, the Plain Text editor

1. Install Atom plugins: [github.com/plain-plain-text/atom-configs/](http://github.com/plain-plain-text/atom-configs)
1. Clone your own `simple-cv` fork repository from GitHub
1. Link Atom to GitHub
1. Start editing

Note: Atom is brought to us by the people at GitHub. It probably won‚Äôt win you
any cool kid awards amongst your hacker nerd friends, but it‚Äôs an easy editor
to learn, I think, and its Git integration is tip-top.

## Key Files in Simple-CV

* üìÅ metadata (YAML metadata files)
    * format.yml
    * html-options.yml
    * pdf-options.yml
    * personal.yml
* üìÅ docs (the files that make up the webpage)
* üìÅ sections (Markdown files that make up the content)
* üìÅ templates (TeX and html templates to fill with CV content)
* process.ps1 (Windows Powershell script to generate CVs)
* process.sh (MacOS / Linux script to generate CVs)
* sections.txt (List of files in sections folder to put CV in order)

---

## Adding a Milestone: Atom

1. Edit metadata files
1. Edit sections files, add new ones, edit sections.txt
1. Process files via interactive shell
1. Save, Stage, Commit

---

## Putting the Work Online as a Webpage

1. Push
1. There is no step 2.
